## Epic7 Shop Refresher
A rewrite of the script done originally by [EmaOlay](https://github.com/EmaOlay/E7-Auto-Shop-Refresh) that automatically refreshes the shop and buys covenant bookmarks and mystics.

### Requirements
- requires python 3
- pip install -r requirements.txt
- run main.py in admin


Works fine on my screen (1080p) with the emulator maximized but may need some tinkering to get it to work on others.
Taking new screenshots of the buttons on whatever screen resolutions you're using and setting the x & y offset of the item buy button should fix any problems.


- I might try in the future (whenever I'm free) to connect directly to adb to prevent any problems.
